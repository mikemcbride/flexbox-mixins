# Flexbox Mixins
Flexbox is awesome. Unfortunately, it's still new enough that the properties don't have consistent values across browsers. This is a set of LESS mixins that I wrote to make it cross-browser compatible and easy to use.

## How to use
- These mixins require [LESS](http://www.lesscss.org)
- Inside your project, create a `main.less` file. In that file, add `@import "flexbox.less";` and you're good to go!
